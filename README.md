Algorithm Visualizer

Overview
Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web-based tool to visualize various sorting and searching algorithms. With a beautiful, responsive interface, users can see how different algorithms work step-by-step, enhancing understanding of algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more. It supports features like speed control, custom input arrays, and step-by-step execution.

Features

Multiple Algorithms: Supports sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) and searching algorithms (BFS, DFS).
Interactive Visualization: Visualize each algorithm step, with bars representing elements being compared and swapped.
Speed Control: Adjust the speed of the visualization using a slider.
Custom Input: Enter your array to visualize with any supported algorithms.
Pause/Resume/Reset: Control the animation flow with start, pause, resume, and reset functionality.
Light/Dark Mode Toggle: Choose between a light or dark theme for the interface.

Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
Visualization Libraries: Custom-built for sorting and search algorithms
Version Control: Git and GitHub for source code management
Responsive Design: Ensures compatibility on mobile and desktop browsers
